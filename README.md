This is a past school project that I want to improve. 
I will only share my Python's program because I don't want the data to be public.
The project obectif is to determine some specifics values in a bench of data . There is three labels (1, 2, 3) and we have to determine what data is label 2.
But label 2 represents only 1/30 of the all data so we have to create some more to determine them easily.
There is at this day three differents programs : 
- The first one is 'files_processing.py'. It's use to extract data from the data files, concatenate them and separate them from their label.
- The second one is 'create_data.py'. It's use to create new data from the label's 2 data.
- the third one is 'Random_Forest.py'. It's use to make the magic append and dertmine which data is label 2 or not.
